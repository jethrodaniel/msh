msh is a ruby shell.

**NOTE**: still in early stages, subject to breaking changes until `v1.0.0`.

## Goals

Use ruby in the shell

- global interpolation
- use ruby methods as functions, aliases, and in interpolation
- use ruby variables for environment variables

Be as simple and understandable as possible, while doing as much as possible
without external dependencies.

- dependencies should be lightweight, with no gem extensions

## Dependencies

ðŸ’¯ percent Ruby, no C dependencies. Only 2 runtime dependencies

- [ast](https://github.com/whitequark/ast)
- [paint](https://github.com/janlelis/paint)

## Installation

Assuming you have Ruby installed:

```
$ gem install msh
$ msh -h
<%= `msh -h` %>
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] version 1.0.0 - when I can use msh as my daily driver
- [ ] version 2.0.0 - may be a mruby port, in order to package as a static executable

## Development

```
$ bundle exec rake -T     # `rake install` to install locally
$ bundle exec bin/console # load Msh up in a Ruby REPL
$ bundle exec bin/lexer   # Run the lexer
$ bundle exec bin/parser  # Run the parser
$ bundle exec exe/msh     # Run Msh
$ bundle exec yard server --reload # View documentation in a browser
```

## Testing

msh has more tests than you can shake a stick at.

Most of these come from a [single YAML file](./spec/fixtures/examples.yml)...

```yml
<%= `sed -n '5,22p' spec/fixtures/examples.yml` %>
...
```

and are `eval`'d during the specs.

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

You can also check out [the CI](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/actions/) to see the specs' last executions ðŸ”ª.
