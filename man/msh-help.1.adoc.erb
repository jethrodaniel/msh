help - msh man pages

== synopsis

*help* [_topic_]...

== description

Msh's _help_ builtin is just a wrapper around the _man_ command, such that topics are prefixed with _msh-_.

    msh> help help   #=> same as `man msh-help`
    msh> help        #=> same as `man msh`
    msh> help wtf    #=> No manual entry for msh-wtf

Msh modifies your $MANPATH so these are available. To install them outside of msh, either add msh's man directory to your $MANPATH, or install it's manpages on your system the traditional way.

    MANPATH="$MANPATH:`dirname \`gem which msh\``/../man" man msh

    cp -r `dirname \`gem which msh\``/../man/man1/ /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    mandb
    man msh

== msh

Part of msh(1).
