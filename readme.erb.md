## installation

Assuming you have Ruby installed:

```
$ gem install msh
$ msh -h
<%= `msh -h` %>
```

## what it do

```msh
echo "#{Time.now}" | cowsay
```

Configuration is in `~/.config/msh/config.rb`

```ruby
Msh.configure do |c|
  c.color = true
  c.history = {:size => 10.megabytes}
end
```

## development

see the rakefile

```sh
$ bundle exec rake -T
<%= `bundle exec rake -T` %>
```

### testing

msh has more tests than you can shake a stick at.

Most of these come from a [single YAML file](./spec/fixtures/examples.yml)...

```yml
<%= `sed -n '5,22p' spec/fixtures/examples.yml` %>
...
```

and are `eval`'d during the specs.

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

You can also check out [the CI](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/actions/) to see the specs' last executions ðŸ”ª.
