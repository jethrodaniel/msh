msh is a ruby shell.

Its goal is the same as that of Ruby

**note**:

- msh is still in the design stage, and will be subject to breaking changes until a `v1.0.0` release.

- this readme is only intended for basic installation and development. See the `help` builtin, the main manpage ([erb](man/msh.1.adoc.erb), [text](spec/fixtures/help/msh.txt)), and the [man directory](./man) for more information.

## supported rubies

- [x] CRuby >= 2.5
- [ ] JRuby

## dependencies

Msh has the following runtime dependencies

- `man`, `less`, or `cat` for the `help` builtin (todo: implement in ruby)
- ~~[reline](https://github.com/ruby/reline) (requires 1 C dependency on [io-console](https://github.com/ruby/io-console))~~
- [readline](https://github.com/ruby/readline-ext/) (C, comes with CRuby)
- [ast](https://github.com/whitequark/ast/) (Ruby, no dependencies)

To build the lexer, parser, and manpages

- [racc](https://github.com/ruby/racc)
- [rexical](https://github.com/tenderlove/rexical)
- [asciidoctor](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor)

Msh ships with the generated files, though, so these are just build time dependencies.

## installation

Assuming you have Ruby installed:

```
$ gem install msh
$ msh -h
a ruby shell

Usage:
    msh [options]... [file]...

Options:
    -h, --help                       print this help
    -V, --version                    show the version   (0.1.0)
        --copyright, --license       show the copyright (MIT)
    -c  <cmd_string>                 runs <cmd_string> as shell input
```

## development

see the rakefile

```sh
$ bundle exec rake -T
rake build              # Build msh-0.1.0.gem into the pkg directory
rake clean              # Remove any temporary products
rake clobber            # Remove any generated files
rake install            # Build and install msh-0.1.0.gem into system gems
rake install:local      # Build and install msh-0.1.0.gem into system gems without network access
rake lint               # Run RuboCop
rake lint:auto_correct  # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
rake man                # generate the man pages
rake man:check          # verify man pages are in sync
rake msh                # build everything
rake readme             # generates readme.md from ERB
rake release[remote]    # Create tag v0.1.0 and build and push msh-0.1.0.gem to TODO: Set to 'https://rubygems.org'
rake run                # build everything and run msh
rake spec               # Run RSpec code examples
rake spec:examples      # create sample msh scripts from spec/examples.yaml
rake spec:help          # dump results from `help` builtin to text files for specs
```

run `./bin/console` to load up msh in a REPL.

### testing

msh has more tests than you can shake a stick at.

Most of these come from a [single YAML file](./spec/fixtures/examples.yml)...

```yml
:examples:
  # words, filenames, options, etc

  "echo such wow":
    :valid: true
    :tokens: |
      [[:WORD, "echo"],
       [:WORD, "such"],
       [:WORD, "wow"]]
    :ast: |
      s(:EXPR,
        s(:COMMAND,
          s(:WORD, "echo"),
          s(:WORD, "such"),
          s(:WORD, "wow")))

  "echo so scare":
    :valid: true
...
```

and are `eval`'d during the specs.

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

You can also check out [the CI](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/actions/) to see the specs' last executions ðŸ”ª.
