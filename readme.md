## installation

Build everything

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh
cd msh
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

At that point, you have the following executables

- `bin/msh` - single executable, uses MRuby
- `bin/msh.rb` - single ruby script

## development

```
bundle exec rake mruby
bundle exec rake test
```

We're using Github Actions to do that automatically - check out [the
CI](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/actions/) to see the specs' lastest
executions ðŸ”ª.
