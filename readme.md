**note**: still nascent, breaking changes until `v1.0.0`, stay tuned.

msh is a Ruby shell.

## Goals

- Use ruby in the shell
  - global interpolation
  - use ruby methods as functions and aliases
  - jump to the Ruby repl at any time
- Use less of the sh
  - restricted subset of sh/bash
- Be simple
- Be lightweight
  - packaged as a single binary
- Be self-documenting

## Installation

Msh is both a CRuby gem and a MRuby mgem.

Assuming you have CRuby installed:

```
$ gem install msh
$ msh -h
```

To build a binary with MRuby

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh
cd msh
make release
```

Or download the prebuilt binaries for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/releases).


## Roadmap

- [ ] version 1.0.0 - when I can use msh as my daily driver

## Development

See `rake -T` and tools in `./bin/`.

## Testing

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec
$ make
```

Check out [the CI](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/actions/) to see the specs' last executions ðŸ”ª.

## Alternatives

i.e, alternative shells. If there's a _legit_ shell out there that chooses to
be something more than a `sh/bash/zsh` clone, feel free to add it here.
