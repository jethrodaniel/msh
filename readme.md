See the main [manpage](man/msh.1.adoc).

## installation

Msh is both a CRuby gem and a MRuby mgem.

```
$ gem install msh # cruby
$ make release    # mruby
```

Make sure you `git clone --recursive` or run `git submodule update`, since MRuby is a submodule.

**todo**: download the prebuilt binaries for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/releases) (see [the release action](.github/workflows/release.yml)).

**note**: mruby redirection and pipes won't work until we have `IO#reopen`

## development

See `rake -T` and tools in `./bin/`.

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec # cruby
$ make                  # mruby
```

Check out [the CI](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/actions/) to see the specs' last executions ðŸ”ª.
