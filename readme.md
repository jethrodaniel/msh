## development

see the rakefile

```sh
$ bundle exec rake -T
rake build              # Build msh-0.1.0.gem into the pkg directory
rake clean              # Remove any temporary products
rake clobber            # Remove any generated files
rake docs               # generate the docs/
rake install            # Build and install msh-0.1.0.gem into system gems
rake install:local      # Build and install msh-0.1.0.gem into system gems without network access
rake lint               # Run RuboCop
rake lint:auto_correct  # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
rake msh                # build everything
rake release[remote]    # Create tag v0.1.0 and build and push msh-0.1.0.gem to TODO: Set to 'http://mygemserver.com'
rake run                # build everything and run msh
rake spec               # Run RSpec code examples
```

### testing

msh has more tests than you can shake a stick at.

Most of these come from a [single YAML file](./spec/fixtures/examples.yml)...

```yml
:examples:
  #
  # pipes
  #
  "fortune | cowsay":
    :valid: true
    :tokens: |
      [[:WORD, "fortune"],
       [:PIPE, "|"],
       [:WORD, "cowsay"]]
    :ast: |
      s(:EXPR,
        s(:PIPELINE,
          s(:COMMAND,
            s(:WORD, "fortune")),
          s(:COMMAND,
            s(:WORD, "cowsay"))))

...
```

and are `eval`'d during the specs.

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec
```
