**NOTE**: still in early stages, subject to breaking changes until `v1.0.0`.

msh is a Ruby shell.

```
$ echo Ï€ is #{Math::PI} | cowsay

## Goals

- Use ruby in the shell
  - global interpolation
  - use ruby methods as functions and aliases
  - jump to the Ruby repl at any time
- Use less of the sh
  - restricted subset of sh/bash
- Be simple
- Be lightweight

## Installation

Assuming you have Ruby installed:

```
$ gem install msh
$ msh -h
```

Or download the prebuilt binaries to use via MRuby (todo).

## Roadmap

- [ ] version 1.0.0 - when I can use msh as my daily driver

## Development

See `rake -T` and tools in `./bin/`.

## Testing

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec
```
