**NOTE**: not finished, breaking changes until `v1.0.0`, stay tuned.

**NOTE**: mruby redirection and pipes won't work until we get mruby to support `IO#reopen`

msh is a Ruby shell.

## about

See the main [manpage](man/msh.adoc).

## installation

Build everything

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh
cd msh
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

At that point, you have the following executables

- `bin/msh` - single executable, uses MRuby
- `bin/msh.rb` - single ruby script

You can also build and install as a `.deb` or `.rpm` using `rake pkg:deb`
or `pkg:rpm` - this means you get the manpages installed as well.

## development

```
bundle exec rake
```

We're using Github Actions to do that automatically - check out [the
CI](https://github.com/jethrodaniel/msh/actions/) to see the specs' lastest
executions ðŸ”ª.
