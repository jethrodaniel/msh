HELP(1)                           Msh Manual                           HELP(1)

NAME
       help - msh man pages

SYNOPSIS
       help [topic]...

DESCRIPTION
       Msh’s help builtin is just a wrapper around the man command, such that
       topics are prefixed with msh-.

           msh> help help   #=> same as `man msh-help`
           msh> help        #=> same as `man msh`
           msh> help wtf    #=> No manual entry for msh-wtf

       Msh modifies your $MANPATH so these are available. To install them
       outside of msh, either add msh’s man directory to your $MANPATH, or
       install it’s manpages on your system the traditional way.

           MANPATH="$MANPATH:`dirname \`gem which msh\``/../man" man msh

           cp -r `dirname \`gem which msh\``/../man/man1/ /usr/local/share/man/man1/
           mandb
           man msh

MSH
       Part of msh(1).
