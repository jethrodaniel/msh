DESIGN(1)                         Msh Manual                         DESIGN(1)

NAME
       design - msh's design and goals

SYNOPSIS
       design

DESIGN AND GOALS
   grammar
       Notably horric things about typical shells

       ·   lexing, parsing, and interpretation are not distinct phases

       ·   parameter expansion ${expression}

       ·   case syntax

       ·   functions and parameters_$1_, etc

       ·   variables (global by default, no space before =, etc)

       Msh tries to keep things simple, and uses Ruby to do most of that

       ·   functions are just Ruby methods

       ·   variables are just Ruby variables

       To do this, Msh preprocesses all input as ERB, and provides the repl
       builtin.

MSH
       Part of msh(1).
